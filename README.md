# Complaint System in C++
## Project Overview
This Complaint System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows student to file complaint and also admins to check the complaints filed by student. This system enables student to file complaint simply by logging in if they had registered an account or else they can register a new account.

3. Complaint Management
   - Staff members can view a list of all complaints, their status and update them as needed
4. Data Persistence
   - The system stores complaint data and user information in text files for easy access and retrieval

## Technologies Used:
1. C++ Programming Language
2. Object-oriented programming principles
3. File Handling
4. Console-based user interface

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Compile the code: Use a C++ compiler to build the executable
3. Run the application: Execute the compiled executable

## Addtional Information
1. Future Improvements
   - Consider adding features like email nortifications for complaint updates or a more sophisticated user interface.
